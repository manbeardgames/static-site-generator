        "You wake up and find yourself trapped in a room inside a ruined structure. The ceiling is closing, and you have no way to climb out. You're a slime after all, how can you climb. Once the ceiling has closed in, it will fall, squishing you like it has done to so many before. You're only hope is to find some way to stop the ceiling from completely closing in on you. Are you only going to be prolonging your eventural death?",
        "Echo was made for Ludum Dare 42, with the theme \"Running out of space\". In this game, the ceiling is sealing itself off. You have to scramble to find active nodes that will push back and delay the ceiling. Eventually, the ceiling will close off and fall on you. While manging this, you will also have to fight off a horde of dead slimes who have died before you. They cose in fast and overwhelm quickly if not dealt with."
